Want to use dynamic programming. If you previously calculated that the
state you're in now leads to loss, it shouldn't recalculate. It should
just immediately return loss. Same with tie and win.

if player's hands are 0:
    return 1 (AI win)
if AI's hands are 0
    return -1 (Player win)
if current state has been seen before in the current path
    return 0
