This project is a command-line version of the finger game, Chopsticks. The goal
is to make the game playable with 2 local players or with 1  player and a
perfect AI that is unbeatable.

I'm working on this project to gain more experience with Python and for fun.
Also the rules are the ones that I followed when I played the game as a child.
Some people may have played other versions. I will  write a clear explanation of
my rules in the README when I finish the game. This project is still in progress
and remains unfinished.
